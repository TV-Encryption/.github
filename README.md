_Prototype of a key management system for live video stream encryption._

These repositories were created as part of a bachelor thesis at [ZHAW Winterthur](https://www.zhaw.ch). Therefore the code is not actively being maintained.

To get an overview of the systems, it is beneficial to read the [thesis](Documents/Bachelor_Thesis_TV_Encryption.pdf).
